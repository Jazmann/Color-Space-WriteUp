\begin{abstract}
An efficient, lossless, chromatic color space employing a redistribution focused on an individual's particular chromatic skin statistics with application to the detection of blood flow. A color space transform is developed which avoids floating point operations, but which retains all the information contained in a source RGB image is developed and implemented. Several methods for feature detection, including a bespoke Canny edge detector which is designed to avoid some of the problems associated with feature detection in a chromatic space are implemented, and a proof of concept for a mechanical fingertip-stress detector is developed for an iOS device using the OpenCV computer vision library in C++ and shown to be not just possible, but effective on current devices.
